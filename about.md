title: Tearing weird pieces apart

I'm a student from Bavaria, Germany with this weird drive for researching all kinds of stuff from a low-level perspective.
I occasionally hack on things, enjoy break weird machines or just find fun in writing something down. This is what this
blog is built around.

I hold the strong belief that learning is important and intend to use this blog to archive my journeys and thoughts and
provide them as educational and entertaining resources for learning more about various aspects of InfoSec, hacking, tech
and programming, from a perspective where learning resources generally are sparse.

The writeups and information I provide are neither published for malicious intents nor condone their use for malicious
behavior. The sole purpose behind everything I write is to be found enjoyable, informative or interesting by my audience.

If you have any questions, thoughts or just want to have a chat, don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

Further, this blog is [open source](https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}/personal-blog) and is based on the wonderful
